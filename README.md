# PSIML8-DeepCFD
This project was done during a summer school of machine learning PSIML 8. Here, you can find my code and the slides from the presentation I gave during the summer school.

The goal of the project is to predict the velocity and pressure of a steady-state laminar flow from the input data. The input data are images that give information about the channel through which fluid is moving. For this, U-net architecture was used.

The project is based on the paper https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.08826 and the GitHub page https://github.com/mdribeiro/DeepCFD. There, you find more information about the project. Also, there, you can find the toy data set that was used for training my model.
